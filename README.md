# AscentofNations


The hunt went well, as you return to your village with your companion a streak of smoke in the sky is clearly noticable.
Both of you run to the village but alas, the chieftain's hut is already burnt down.

[[Organise a crew to help put out the fire->Village fire]]
[[Gather what you can find and go to safety->Run]]
[[Kill everyone you hate and take their possesions ->Kill]]
	[[What do I have? -> Inventory]]
    It takes hours but you and the 20 other survivors manage to put the fire out, all you manage to recover from the fire is some food to last you for one month and some construction supply such as lumber and ropes.
